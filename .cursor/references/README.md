## Adding New Documentation

When creating new documentation:

1. Use descriptive filenames (kebab-case)
2. Include an overview section explaining what the feature does
3. Document the problem it solves
4. Include code examples and patterns
5. Document known issues and their solutions
6. Add a testing checklist
7. Include version history

## Updating Documentation

All documentation files are "living documents" - they should be updated:

- When new patterns or solutions are discovered
- When edge cases are encountered
- When bugs are fixed
- When improvements are made

Do not wait to be asked - proactively maintain documentation as part of completing any task.
